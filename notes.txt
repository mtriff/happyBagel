=== note ID's === 
each note maintains it's unique id
once a note gets deleted, the id does not get reused
--> onCreate will create a note with id = scope.id++
--> onLoad: find (sorted by ID) and display the sorted list of notes
		we also need to set scope.id to the highest id from the results
--> onDelete: just remove the note with id from db
--> update: find by Id, easy because they are unique
